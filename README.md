**DeftDAO: Revolutionizing Decentralized Exchanges with RFQ Mechanisms**

Welcome to DeftDAO, where we're reshaping the landscape of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with our RFQ (Request for Quote) based platform. Traditional DEX environments often face challenges such as front running and slippage issues. DeftDAO addresses these concerns by leveraging RFQ systems, enhancing price discovery and ensuring traders receive the best available prices.

### About DeftDAO

DeftDAO's RFQ DEX facilitates efficient price discovery by enabling multiple market makers to directly provide competitive quotes to traders. By utilizing Chainlink price feeds, such as Eth/USD, sellers can leverage market prices and request better quotes, enhancing transparency and fairness in trading.

### Key Features

- **RFQ Mechanisms**: DeftDAO's RFQ system allows for competitive quotes directly from market makers, mitigating issues like front running and slippage.
  
- **Chainlink Price Feeds**: Leveraging Chainlink price feeds, DeftDAO ensures accurate and reliable market prices for traders.
  
- **Account Abstraction**: DeftDAO explores the possibility of implementing account abstraction for enhanced functionality and security within the DEX.

### Building DeftDAO

DeftDAO's development is driven by a commitment to addressing the challenges of traditional DEXs and enhancing user experience. We utilize Scaffold Eth Template for seamless deployment and leverage technologies such as Covalent Price History APIs for comprehensive market data analysis.

### Challenges and Future Plans

While deploying the project, we encountered challenges with verifying on Scan, which we're actively working to resolve. We're committed to refining DeftDAO's functionality and usability, and we welcome feedback from the community to improve and expand the platform.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind DeftDAO stems from the need to address specific challenges encountered in traditional decentralized exchange environments. These challenges include front running and slippage issues, which often lead to inefficient price discovery and unfair trading practices. DeftDAO aims to revolutionize decentralized exchanges by introducing RFQ (Request for Quote) mechanisms, enabling traders to obtain competitive quotes directly from market makers, thereby ensuring fair and transparent trading.

## What it does

DeftDAO facilitates efficient price discovery by allowing multiple market makers to provide competitive quotes directly to traders through RFQ mechanisms. By leveraging Chainlink price feeds, DeftDAO ensures accurate market prices, empowering traders to obtain the best available prices for their transactions. Additionally, the platform explores the possibility of implementing account abstraction for enhanced functionality and security within the DEX.

## How we built it

DeftDAO was built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies and innovative approaches. We utilized Scaffold Eth Template for seamless deployment and integrated Chainlink price feeds to provide accurate and reliable market prices. Despite encountering challenges with verifying the project on Scan, we remain committed to refining the platform's functionality and usability.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges, including difficulties with verifying the project on Scan and technical errors with integrating Covalent Price History APIs for data visualization. Despite these challenges, we persevered and remained dedicated to delivering a robust and reliable platform for decentralized exchange.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we're proud to have achieved several milestones with DeftDAO. We successfully implemented RFQ mechanisms for competitive quote provision, integrated Chainlink price feeds for accurate market prices, and explored the potential implementation of account abstraction for enhanced security. Additionally, we received positive feedback from early testers and stakeholders within the community, affirming the platform's potential impact on decentralized exchange mechanisms.

## What we learned

The development of DeftDAO has been a valuable learning experience for our team. We gained insights into the complexities of decentralized exchange environments, the importance of accurate market pricing, and the challenges associated with integrating external APIs. Additionally, we learned the significance of community engagement and feedback in shaping the platform's features and functionalities.

## What's next for DeftDAO

Moving forward, we're excited to continue enhancing DeftDAO and expanding its capabilities. Our future plans include resolving the challenges encountered with verifying the project on Scan, refining the platform's user interface for improved usability, and exploring additional features to further enhance decentralized exchange mechanisms. We remain committed to delivering a transparent, efficient, and secure trading experience for all users of DeftDAO.
